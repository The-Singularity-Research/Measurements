# Measurements
This repo is about measurements in quantum circuits and quantum computation. Measurements can be understood in many ways, we will primarily use linear algebra to interpret quantum circuit diagrams such as in the [Qubit Rotation Tutorial](https://github.com/The-Singularity-Research/Video1-Qubit-Rotation). We will discuss measurements in different bases and with various kinds of operators. We will also look at "expectation values", and we will provide PennyLane code to reproduce the calculations on actual quantum computers as well as on simulation devices.
